Hodur is a descriptive domain modeling approach and related collection
of libraries for Clojure.

By using Hodur you can define your domain model as data, parse and
validate it, and then either consume your model via an API making your
apps respond to the defined model or use one of the many plugins to
help you achieve mechanical, repetitive results faster and in a purely
functional manner.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
This Hodur plugin provides the ability to generate [[https://github.com/walmartlabs/lacinia][Lacinia]] schemas out
of your Hodur model. Lacinia will let you spin off a [[https://graphql.org/][GraphQL server]] in
minutes.

* Motivation

  For a deeper insight into the motivations behind Hodur, check the
  [[https://github.com/luchiniatwork/hodur-engine/blob/master/docs/MOTIVATION.org][motivation doc]].

* Getting Started

  Hodur has a highly modular architecture. [[https://github.com/luchiniatwork/hodur-engine][Hodur Engine]] is always
  required as it provides the meta-database functions and APIs
  consumed by plugins.

  Therefore, refer the [[https://github.com/luchiniatwork/hodur-engine#getting-started][Hodur Engine's Getting Started]] first and then
  return here for Lacinia-specific setup.

  After having set up ~hodur-engine~ as described above, we also need
  to add ~hodur/lacinia-schema~, a plugin that creates Lacinia Schemas
  out of your model to the ~deps.edn~ file:

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
  {:deps {hodur/engine         {:mvn/version "0.1.5"}
          hodur/lacinia-schema {:mvn/version "0.1.2"}}}
#+END_SRC

  You should ~require~ it any way you see fit:

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
  (require '[hodur-engine.core :as hodur])
  (require '[hodur-lacinia-schema.core :as hodur-lacinia])
#+END_SRC

  Let's expand our ~Person~ model from the original getting started by
  "tagging" the ~Person~ entity for Lacinia. You can read more about
  the concept of tagging for plugins in the sessions below but, in
  short, this is the way we, model designers, use to specify which
  entities we want to be exposed to which plugins.

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
  (def meta-db (hodur/init-schema
                '[^{:lacinia/tag-recursive true}
                  Person
                  [^String first-name
                   ^String last-name]]))
#+END_SRC

  The ~hodur-lacinia-schema~ plugin exposes a function called ~schema~
  that generates your model as a Lacinia schema payload:

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
  (def lacinia-schema (hodur-lacinia/schema meta-db))
#+END_SRC

  When you inspect ~lacinia-schema~, this is what you have:

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
  {:objects
   {:Person
    {:fields
     {:firstName {:type (non-null String)},
      :lastName {:type (non-null String)}}}}}
#+END_SRC

  Assuming Lacinia's ~com.walmartlabs.lacinia.schema~ is bound to
  ~schema~, you can initialize your instance by compiling the schema like this:

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
  (def compiled-schema (-> lacinia-schema
                           schema/compile))
#+END_SRC

  Most certainly you will have some resolvers defined in your schema
  (say ~:person-query/resolver~ that you want to bind to function
  ~person-query-resolver~). In this case, attach the resolvers using
  Lacinia's ~com.walmartlabs.lacinia.util/attach-resolvers~ function
  (shown in this next example as bound to ~util/attach-resolvers~:

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
  (def compiled-schema (-> lacinia-schema
                           (util/attach-resolvers
                            {:person-query/resolver person-query-resolver})
                           schema/compile))
#+END_SRC

* Model Definition

  All Hodur plugins follow the [[https://github.com/luchiniatwork/hodur-engine#model-definition][Model Definition]] as described on Hodur
  [[https://github.com/luchiniatwork/hodur-engine#model-definition][Engine's documentation]].

* Query, Mutation, and Subscription Roots

  GraphQL is not a pure graph interface in the sense of enabling
  consumers to start traversing from any node. Instead, it has the
  concept of "roots" where queries, mutations, or subscriptions can
  start.

  To define a query root, use the marker ~:lacinia/query~. In the
  example below we are defining an entity named ~QueryRoot~ marked as
  Lacinia's query root. It has a single field ~game-by-id~ that
  returns a ~BoardGame~.

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
  [^{:lacinia/tag-recursive true
     :lacinia/query true}
   QueryRoot
   [^BoardGame game-by-id [^{:type ID
                             :optional true} id]]]
#+END_SRC

  The same principle applies to mutations and subscriptions. A root
  entity must be defined for each and marked with ~:lacinia/mutation~
  and ~:lacinia/subscription~ respectively.

* Resolvers and Streamers

  In order to provide functionality to your GraphQL interface you will
  need to create resolvers and attach them to your graph tree. Lacinia
  will take care of building the call stack and stitching up the
  response.

  A resolver is defined by using the marker ~:lacinia/resolve~ that
  can be used in any field. This marker takes a key that will later be
  used by ~com.walmartlabs.lacinia.util/attach-resolvers~ to map to
  real functions. The following example shows how to mark the
  ~game-by-id~ field to the resolver ~:query/game-by-id~:

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
  [^:lacinia/query
   QueryRoot
   [^{:type BoardGame
      :lacinia/resolve :query/game-by-id}
    game-by-id [^{:type ID
                  :optional true} id]]]
#+END_SRC

  Subscriptions use streamer functions instead of resolvers. Lacinia
  invokes a streamer function once, to initialize the subscription
  stream. The streamer is provided with a source stream callback
  function; as new values are available they are passed to this
  callback. Typically, the streamer will create a thread, ~core.async~
  process, or other long-lived construct to feed values to the source
  stream.

  Streamers are defined by using the marker ~:lacinia/stream~:

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
  [^:lacinia/subscription
   SubscriptionRoot
   [^{:type Person
      :lacinia/stream :person/stream}
    listen-to-person [^ID id]]]
#+END_SRC

* Interfaces, Unions, and Enums

  GraphQL supports interfaces, unions and enums. Simply marking your
  entities accordingly is enough to signal to Hodur Lacinia Schema
  that you want to use them.

  Refer to [[https://github.com/luchiniatwork/hodur-engine#model-definition][Hodur Engine's Model Definition documentation]] for more
  details.

* Input Objects

  GraphQL requires that objects that are sent as parameters to
  mutations be defined as separate entities.

  In the Hodur Lacinia schema this can be drastically simplified by
  using the marker ~:lacinia/input~ on the entity you want to use as
  an input object as shown below:

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
  [^{:lacinia/tag-recursive true
     :lacinia/input true}
   Employee
   [^{:type String} name
    ^{:type Float}  salary]]
#+END_SRC

* Optional and Default Params


  By default, Hodur assumes that all parameters are mandatory. In
  order to make them optional, they need to be marked with
  ~:optional~. A common pattern is to make a parameter optional while
  also assigning a default value to it with ~:default~:

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
  [QueryRoot
   [employees-by-location [^{:type String
                             :optional true
                             :default "HQ"} location]]]
#+END_SRC
